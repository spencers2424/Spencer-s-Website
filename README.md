<h3> Project 1: Fantasy Basketball Optimization
<br>
<br> One project I have completd while at the University of Iowa was one in my free time. I was able to optimize the amount of games my Fantasy Basketball players played by collecting the data of the ESPN NBA schedule for the week. From there, I used IF statements and the COUNT function to determine the amount of games a team played for the week. By doing this, it allowed me to target free agents with a high number of games for the week. This led me to be in the championship this year for my league. Although no money was on the line, the skills I have been taught allowed me to earn bragging rights and apply the skills learned to real world problems. </h3>

<h3> As displayed in the picture with the teams sorted by number of games, it is beneficial to pick players on teams such as the Miami Heat and Houston Rockets. </h3>

<h3> Project 2: Predicting GDP with Linear Regressions
<br>
<br> Another project I completed was in my Data Management & Visualization class. This was an interesting project because I worked in a group and we studied specific variables that went into a country's happiness level. With the significant variables, we were then able to construct a model that would allow us to forecast happiness for any country given their inputs. This model was a very good predictor, as it had an established R-square of 0.777. </h3>

<h3> As seen in this image, we were able to devise a formula for predicting happiness. Social support was the biggest predictor in terms of variables.
