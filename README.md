<h2> Hello everyone, my name is Spencer and I am in the Master's of Business Analytics & Finance program at the University of Iowa. Thank you for visiting my webpage. Feel free to check out all the projects I have done! </h2>

<h3> Project 1: One project I have completd while at the University of Iowa was one in my free time. I was able to optimize the amount of games my Fantasy Basketball players played by collecting the data of the ESPN NBA schedule for the week. From there, I used IF statements and the COUNT function to determine the amount of games a team played for the week. By doing this, it allowed me to target free agents with a high number of games for the week. This led me to be in the championship this year for my league. Although no money was on the line, the skills I have been taught allowed me to earn bragging rights and apply the skills learned to real world problems. </h3>

<h3> As displayed in the picture with the teams sorted by number of games, it is beneficial to pick players on teams such as the Miami Heat and Houston Rockets. </h3>
